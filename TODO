A Robot is placed at an initial location in a hypothetical infinite grid.
It receives some directions to move in the grid.
Directions could be LEFT / RIGHT / UP / DOWN. A sample direction is LLRRUUD.
On receiving a direction, it changes its position.
Robot lets you ask its final position in (x,y) format.
Robot can also move in just one direction, Left Or Right or Up or Down.
