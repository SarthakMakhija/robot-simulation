A Robot is placed at an initial location in a hypothetical infinite grid.
It receives some directions to move in the grid.
Directions could be LEFT / RIGHT / UP / DOWN. A sample direction is LLRRUUD.
On receiving a direction (as string probably?), it changes its position.
Robot lets you ask its final position in (x,y) format.
